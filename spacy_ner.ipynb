The original annotations have been annotated manually by human annotators, and represent a \"Gold Standard\" against which we can compare our predictions. \n",

    "* precision\n",
    "* recall\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand these metrics, we need to understand the following concepts:\n",

    "* True negatives - How many entities did the model not predict which are actually not entities according to the Gold Standard?\n",
    "* False positives - How many entities did the model predict which are NOT entities according to the Gold Standard?  \n",
    "* False negatives - How many entities did the model \"miss\" - e.g. did not recognize as entities which are entities according to the Gold Standard? \n",
